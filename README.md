# Pure Functions

A Pure Function is defined as a function that:

1. only depends on its own arguments
1. doesnâ€™t produce any side effects
1. always returns the same value for the same arguments

Some benefits of Pure Functions include:

- being immediately testable
- keeping backwards compatibility
- not being responsible for introducing bugs
