# Pure Functions

A Pure Function is a function that always:

1. produces the same output, when given the same input
1. produces zero side effects

A Pure Function is always reliable.

<!--

This library takes those definitions a few steps further. A pure function is defined as a function that also:

1. has a function name that clearly describes what it does
1. has an argument list order that goes from most important to least important
1. assigns default values to optional arguments
1. is relevant to more than one type of programming environment
1. can be easily associated with a single Pure Function library category
1. can be fully explained in one short statement
1. has been tested for every conceivable positive outcome
1. has been tested for every conceivable negative outcome
1. can be summed up in a single usage example
